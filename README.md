## Using the plugin
The plugin creates the object ```window.plugin.printer``` with two methods:

### isServiceAvailable()
Printing is only available on devices capable of multi-tasking (iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 etc.) running iOS 4.2 or later. You can use this function to hide print functionality from users who will be unable to use it.<br>
Function takes a callback function, passed to which is a boolean property. Optionally you can assign the scope in which the callback will be executed as a second parameter (default to *window*).

```javascript
/*
 * Find out if printing is available. Use this for showing/hiding print buttons.
 */
window.plugin.printer.isServiceAvailable(
    function (isAvailable) {
        alert(isAvailable ? 'Service is available' : 'Service NOT available');
    }
);
```

**Android:** The callback function will be called with a second argument which is an array, indicating which printer apps are available for printing.

```javascript
/*
 * Find out if printing is available. Use this to find out which apps are available for printing.
 */
window.plugin.printer.isServiceAvailable(
    function (isAvailable, installedAppIds) {
        alert('The following print apps are installed on your device: ' + installedAppIds.join(', '));
    }
);
```

### print()
Function takes an html string and (optionally) a callback function. Optionally you can assign the scope in which the callback will be executed as a third parameter (default to *window*).

```javascript
// Get HTML string
var page = document.body.innerHTML;

/*
 * Pass an HTML and - optionally - a callback function.
 */
window.plugin.printer.print(page, function (code) {
	switch (code) {
	    case 0:     // printing cancelled (cancel button pressed)
	    case 2:     // printed
	    case 3:     // printing failed
	    case 4:     // page not printed (something wrong happened e.g. service is not available)
	}
}, this);
```

**Android:** An App-ID can be assigned as a platform configuration to indicate which 3rd party printing app shall be used. Otherwise the first found application will be used.

```javascript
/*
 * Pass an HTML and - optionally - a platform specific configuration.
 */
window.plugin.printer.print(page, null, this, { appId: 'epson.print' });
```

## Quirks

### Testing in the iOS Simulator
There's no need to waste lots of paper when testing - if you're using the iOS simulator, select File->Open Printer Simulator to open some dummy printers (print outs will appear as PDF files).

### Adding Page Breaks to Printouts
Use the 'page-break-before' property to specify a page break, e.g.

```html
<p>
First page.
</p>

<p style="page-break-before: always">
Second page.
</p>
```

Note: you will need to add an extra top margin to new pages.
